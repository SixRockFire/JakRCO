# JakRCO
A Jak and Daxter power cell order randomizer (c++)
The program randomizes the order of every cell before Lava Tube. It's also programmed to not put them in an impossible order at any point.

How to:
Probably the easiest way to run the code is through something like https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler.
Just copy the Code.cpp file found in the "Jak cell order randomizer" file, and paste it in its entirety into the compiler. After that you can copy the text from the output window into something more readable


If you have an IDE such as Visual Studio, you can download/copy/clone the code and run this through that too of course.
